  This system is designed to emulate the behaviours of an alarm system that will be used in Driver's
Ed vehicles. The system implements checks to make sure that both the driver and passenger are in their
seats and have their seatbelts buckled. If they are, a green light illuminates letting the driver know
it is safe to start the car. If they are not, an alarm will sound if the driver attempts to start the
car and a message will display the reasons why ignition was inhibitted. Once the car is started, a message
will let the driver know that the engine is running, and the driver may use a dial to turn the headlights
on the car to ON, OFF, or AUTO. AUTO will turn the headlights on when a light sensor detects that it 
is dark outside the car. The headlights will turn off when it become bright again. The driver may press
the ignition button while the car is running to turn it off.
